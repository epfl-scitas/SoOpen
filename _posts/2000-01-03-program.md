# Afternoon: Workshop 

Time: 1:30pm - 4:30pm<br>

During this workshop, you will learn to:

- manage your code by having a private part on [c4science](https://c4science.ch) and a public branch on [GitHub](https://github.com)
- link your code to your data on Zenodo via DOIs
- advertise your work via GitHub pages

The workshop will be general enough for you to be able to use any version management system with Git in the cloud.

In the registration you can indicate whether you are attending only the morning sessions or morning ex-cathedra courses and afternoon workshop.

The worksop will require you to come prepared and with already some technical notions. A list of requirements is provided below.

**By subscribing to the afternoon workshop you commit to arrive to the workshop with a laptop equipped with all the required software installed and configured, including all necessary accounts. You can contact us if you have any questions.**

## Required software and accounts

- a command line interface from which you can call *git*
- an account on <a href="https://c4science.ch">c4science.ch</a>
- an account on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>

## Prerequisites

We expect that workshop participants already know Git basics (clone, pull, push, commit, branch). SCITAS organizes several introductory workshops and the necessary content will be covered in the <i>Data management with Git</i> workshops that will take place on February 14th.
