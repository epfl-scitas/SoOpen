### macOS


The default shell in all versions of macOS is Bash, so no need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal (found in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).

See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a> for an example on how to open the Terminal.

You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.

<a name="bashmac"></a>
### Linux

The default shell is usually Bash, but if your machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to install anything.

## Git


Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
version of your code.

You will need an account at both <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and <a href="https://c4science.ch">c4science.ch</a>
for parts of the Git lesson. 
		  
C4Science is a service managed by SCITAS and any member of a Swiss University can log in with SwitchAAI.

Basic GitHub accounts are free of charge. GitHub being a Cloud service, please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review these <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.

<a name="gitwindows"></a>
### Windows

Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
install (described above).

<a name="gitmac"></a>
### macOS
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">Video Tutorial</a>

<strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
as Git is a command line program.
<strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.
<a name="gitlinux"></a>
### Linux
If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
<code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
<code>sudo dnf install git</code>.
