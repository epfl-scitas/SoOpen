## Joint SCITAS training in collaboration with EPFL Library

### You are writing scientific code? That's good but do you know how to ...

* Share it with others?
* Reuse it after 6 months?
* Publish it and make it useful for the scientific community?
* Keep track of changes, backup, and other safe practice?

### If the answer is **no** then this class is for you !! 

We will present during this class different technics and tools in order for you to know how to share, document, backup and publish your code.

The course is during all the day with seminar class on the morning (open to all) and guided workshop on the afternoon (only 15 places).
Check the program, and register if you want to know more about good coding practice.
